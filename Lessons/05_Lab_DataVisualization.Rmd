## Objectives
1. Answer questions on M4/A4
2. Answer questions on M5 videos
3. Additional comments on videos - expression(), saving plots, factors
4. Perform simple data visualizations in the R package `ggplot`


## Load packages, etc.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Import basic libraries
library(tidyverse);library(lubridate);library(here)

#Library for creating ridge plots
library(ggridges)

#Enhanced color ramps
library(viridis)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(colormap)

#Add pre-set themes <--NEW
library(ggthemes)
```

## Expression function and Saving plots

The expression function can be used when you want to add mathematical symbols and subscripts mixed with regular letter to labels. 

```{r formatted text}

#Create a plot
Plot_text <-
ggplot(data=data.frame(x=0,y=0))+
  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_text(
    x=0,
    y=0.025,
    label=expression(paste("Mean is ", mu,",", R^{2},'=0.6'))
    )

#Print the plot
print(Plot_text)

#Save the plot
ggsave(
  filename = "./Output/Plot_text.jpg",
  plot = Plot_text, 
  height = 4, 
  width = 6, 
  units = "in", 
  dpi = 300
  )

```

## Import Datasets
*Note the use of a string variable the points to the location of the data combined with the `here()` package functionality. This enables us to quickly change where we get our data, i.e., by changing one line of code vs each `read.csv()` command.* 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Assign a variable to the processed data folder location
processed_data = "Data/Processed_KEY"

#Read in data
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients <- read.csv(
  here(processed_data,"NTL-LTER_Lake_Chemistry_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv"),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

EPAair <- read.csv(
  here(processed_data,"EPAair_O3_PM25_NC1819_Processed.csv"), 
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#Fix dates
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate <- ymd(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate)
EPAair$Date <- ymd(EPAair$Date)

```

## A note on factors in plots...
Say we want to plot the number of records each month in the Peter/Paul lakes dataset. How might we do that? What challenges do we face? 

```{r Plot the number of records by month}
#What kind of values are months?

#List unique values

#Plot how many Lake observations occur each month

#Convert month to a factor -- with 12 levels, labelled with month names

#Try again: Plot how many Lake observations occur each month

#Alter to include missing months

#Tidy up the code

```

## More on themes

Themes are used to control the overall appearance of a plot, such as the color, size, font, and style of the various elements in the plot. Themes provide a quick and easy way to change the visual style of a plot, and they allow us to create custom visualizations that fit our specific needs and preferences.

### Themes control the following elements
 * _Plot background_: The background color or fill pattern of the plot area.
 * _Plot title_: The size, font, and position of the plot title.
 * _Axis labels_: The font, size, and position of the x-axis and y-axis labels.
 * _Axis ticks and grid lines_: The color, size, and position of the tick marks and grid lines on the axes.
 * _Legend_: The font, size, and position of the legend.

#Create a base plot to play with
surface_temp_1999_plot <- PeterPaul.chem.nutrients %>% 
  filter(depth == 0 & year4 == 1999) %>% 
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x=sampledate,
      y=temperature_C,
      color=lakename)
    ) + 
  geom_line()

#Show the basic plot

#Apply a theme
surface_temp_1999_plot + 
  theme_gray()

#Apply a ggtheme

#Add a title

my_theme <- theme_base() + 
  theme(
    line = element_line(
      color='red',
      linewidth =2
    ),
    legend.background = element_rect(

      fill = 'orange'
    ),
    legend.title = element_text(
      color='blue'
    )

my_theme <- theme_base()  + 
  theme(
    #line =              element_line(),
    #rect =              element_rect(),
    #text =              element_text(),

    #panel.background =  element_rect(),

    # Modifiying legend.position
    #legend.position = 'right',
    
    #complete = TRUE
    )
```


### Scales
Scales in ggplot are used to map data values to aesthetic properties of plot elements, such as position, size, color, and shape. In addition to the basic types of scales, such as continuous and discrete scales, ggplot also provides date and time scales, and guide scales, which allow us to format and label the x-axis with appropriate date or time values, and to add legends and other visual guides to the plot. With a little bit of practice and experimentation, you can use ggplot to create beautiful and informative data visualizations with customized scales.

## Plotting continuous variables over time: Scatterplot and Line Plot

Exercise: build your own scatterplots of PeterPaul.chem.nutrients

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning = FALSE}

# 1. 
# Plot surface temperatures by day of  year. 
# Color your points by year, and facet by lake in two rows.
# Change the ylab name


#2. 
# Plot temperature by date. Color your points by depth.
# Change the size of your point to 0.5
# Change the color palette to magma and play with direction (+- 1), which one makes more sense?
# Change x axis to include marker/labels every 5 years



```
## Plotting the relationship between two continuous variables: Scatterplot

Exercise: Plot relationships between air quality measurements

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning = FALSE}

# 3. 
# Plot AQI values for ozone by PM2.5, colored by latitude 
# Make the points 50 % transparent
# Add a line of best fit for the linear regression of these variables.




```

## Plotting continuous vs. categorical variables

Exercise: Plot distributions of AQI values for EPAair.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning = FALSE}

# 4. 
# Create several types of plots depicting PM2.5, divided by year. 
# Choose which plot displays the data best and justify your choice. 



```


## Visualization challenge

The following graph displays the counts of specific endpoints measured in neonicotinoid ecotoxicology studies. The way it is visualized, however, is not effective. Make the following coding changes to improve the graph: 

1. Change the ordering of the "Endpoint" factor (function: `reorder`) so that the highest counts are listed first (hint: FUN = length)
2. Plot the barplot with the reordered factor levels. Add this line of code to make the bars show up left to right:   scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(levels(Neonics$Endpoint)))
3. Adjust the x axis labels so they appear at a 45 degree angle. 
4. Change the color and/or border on the bars. Should you have a consistent color across all bars, or a different color for each bar?
```{r}

Neonics <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_raw.csv")
ggplot(Neonics) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Endpoint))



```
